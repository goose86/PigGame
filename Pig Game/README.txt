This Pig Project will go down in history as one of the most challenging and one of the most rewarding projects I have done in school to date. As you know I started this semester late which proved to be difficult as I tried week after week to catch up, but I was always a little behind. I was determined thought not to let frustration get to me and complete this project as best I could while making sure I was understanding the code I was writing. While I managed to get most of the files completed, I have some work still to do on the FourTurnsPlayer and the Simulations. In the Simulations class I am having a difficult time with the syntax for the best hold value and the static method that compares the different players.  I am also having a hard time with the for-loops to run the simulations as well. In Four turns I have an isRolling method but cannot seem to get the math correct. 
While I am turning in what I have completed on the project I do plan to continue to finish it and hopefully have it in by Monday or Tuesday night.
