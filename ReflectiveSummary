For my final project in my freshman Introduction to Computer Science class, I decided to develop a version of the game, Pig Game. 
Pig Game is a dice game that takes strategy to win. I wrote the program in Java in approximately 15 hours with 7 different classes 
to complete. This program helped me learn and understand everything from inheritance and multiple control structures to perfecting 
my algorithms for my methods and classes. One particular class I called PigPlayer was one of my most challenging. PigPlayer included
string methods for player information, booloean methods to check if a player won, and accessors and mutators to keep track of the 
score and games won. This class was also a parent class to 5 other player classes, each with different algorithms that played the 
game differently. My PigGame class was the second hardest of my classes. Inside PigGame were the algorithms that played the game, 
whether it was 1 user vs. CPU, or 2 users against each other. PigGame consisted of 6 methods, numerous variables and static variables, 
and a hefty do-while loop to check the game progress.
